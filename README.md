# The First Peasant Dungeon Adventure

Created for IT140, my very first coding class. This is a simple text-based
adventure game that I created in Python. You have to crawl through the dungeon
and save yourself from certain doom.

Will be featured on Lodomo.dev in the future when I port it to a web-based
version... someday.
